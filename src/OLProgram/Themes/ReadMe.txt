If you want to change the theme (colors, borders and so on), then change the path to the theme file in View\App.xaml.
But you should be aware that I have changed 2 things in ShinyBlue.xaml, which is the default theme file,
 and if you want the GUI to look the same, you need to make the same changes to the theme file you are using (fix margins and padding).
Theme changes I have made can be found by searching for "02350" in ShinyBlue.xaml.
